# NON-PROFIT

### Gordon Tusabe

I would like to create an app or website that will help raise funds for children who are in third world countries that are orphaned due to HIV/AIDs. This site will have access points to let people know the mission for the cause,
 It will also have buttons for different people to donate.
The site will include access to media like photos and videos so that donors are able to see or communicate the children in these countries. This site will include profiles of each child explaining their conditions and other things concerning their lives.
There will be button to show the kinds of fundraising that will be held in different locations and give the specific reason for the fundraising. 
•	This app/ site will be able to list the major medication used by children having HIV i.e 
•	 abacavir (Ziagen)
•	emtricitabine (Emtriva)
•	lamivudine (Epivir)
•	tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Vemlidy)
•	tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread)
•	zidovudine (Retrovir)

There will a be a section that will include diet and the kind of food the children will need to improve their immune system.
Another area of emphasis will be to list the number of countries and areas of operation.
